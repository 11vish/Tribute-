            <p><span class="highlight-name">Kalpana Chawla</span> was the first woman of Indian origin in space. Born in 1961 in Haryana, India, she pursued her dream of aerospace engineering against societal odds and became a NASA astronaut.</p>
            <p>Despite facing challenges and limited resources, she never gave up on her aspirations. She flew on the Space Shuttle Columbia in 1997 and again in 2003, where she tragically lost her life during re-entry.</p>
            <p>Kalpana earned a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab Engineering College before moving to the United States to obtain her Master’s and Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering.</p>
            <p>Her hard work and dedication led her to join NASA, where she contributed to research on computational fluid dynamics and vertical takeoff and landing concepts before being selected as an astronaut in 1994.</p>
            <p>During her time at NASA, she worked tirelessly to promote science and space exploration, inspiring young minds across the globe.</p>
            <p>Her final mission, STS-107, was dedicated to conducting experiments in microgravity. Unfortunately, on February 1, 2003, the Columbia shuttle disintegrated upon re-entry, leading to the loss of all seven crew members.</p>
            <p class="quote">“The path from dreams to success does exist. May you have the vision to find it, the courage to get on to it, and the perseverance to follow it.”</p>
            <p>Her legacy continues to inspire millions of young women and aspiring astronauts worldwide. Several institutions, scholarships, and awards have been named in her honor to encourage space research and education.</p>
